# Profile Picture Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of profile picture functionality in the ReportIt Mobile application. Users can now upload, view, update, and delete their profile pictures with full Firebase Storage integration.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Services (UserService.ts)
- **uploadProfilePicture()**: Uploads a new profile picture to Firebase Storage
- **deleteProfilePicture()**: Removes profile picture from storage and database
- **updateProfilePicture()**: Replaces existing profile picture with new one
- **Profile Picture Storage**: Images stored in `profile_pictures/{userId}/{filename}` structure

### 2. Database Schema Updates (UserProfile Interface)
- Added `profilePictureURL?: string` - Public download URL for the image
- Added `profilePicturePath?: string` - Storage path for file management

### 3. Firebase Configuration
- Added Firebase Storage service initialization
- Properly exported storage instance for use across the app

### 4. EditProfileScreen Enhancements
- **Image Selection**: Camera and gallery picker with platform-specific UI
- **Upload Progress**: Visual feedback during image upload
- **Image Preview**: Shows current profile picture with camera icon overlay
- **Remove Option**: Ability to delete profile picture
- **Permission Handling**: Requests camera and gallery permissions

### 5. MapScreen Sidebar Integration
- **Profile Picture Display**: Shows user's profile picture in hamburger menu
- **Fallback to Initials**: Falls back to user initials if no profile picture
- **Responsive Design**: Properly styled for sidebar context

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Upload Process
1. User selects image from camera or gallery
2. Image is converted to blob format
3. Unique filename generated with timestamp
4. File uploaded to Firebase Storage
5. Download URL retrieved and stored in user profile
6. UI updated to reflect new profile picture

### Security Considerations
- Images stored in user-specific folders in Firebase Storage
- Proper permission handling for camera and gallery access
- File size and format validation through expo-image-picker
- Secure Firebase Storage rules (to be configured separately)

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for upload failures
- Permission denied scenarios
- Network connectivity issues
- Storage quota limitations
- Invalid file formats

## User Experience Features

### Visual Feedback
- Upload progress indicator with overlay
- Success/error messages via Alert dialogs
- Immediate UI updates after successful operations
- Camera icon overlay indicating editability

### Platform Compatibility
- iOS: Native ActionSheet for image selection options
- Android: Alert dialog with action buttons
- Expo image picker for consistent cross-platform behavior
- Proper aspect ratio (1:1) enforcement for profile pictures

### Accessibility
- Clear visual indicators for interactive elements
- Descriptive text for upload states
- Proper contrast ratios for overlay elements

## Dependencies Used
- `expo-image-picker`: For camera and gallery access
- `firebase/storage`: For file storage and management
- `react-native-vector-icons`: For camera and user icons

## Files Modified
1. **services/UserService.ts**: Added profile picture management methods
2. **screens/EditProfileScreen.tsx**: Added image upload UI and functionality
3. **screens/MapScreen.tsx**: Added profile picture display in sidebar
4. **config/firebase.ts**: Added Storage service configuration

## Future Enhancements
- Image compression for better performance
- Multiple image sizes (thumbnails, full resolution)
- Batch upload capabilities
- Image cropping functionality
- Profile picture history/version management

## Testing Considerations
- Test upload with various image formats
- Test error scenarios (network failure, permissions)
- Test UI responsiveness on different screen sizes
- Verify proper cleanup of old profile pictures
- Test performance with large image files

## Configuration Required
- Firebase Storage rules need to be configured for proper security
- Storage bucket permissions for authenticated users
- File size and type restrictions in Firebase console
