---

## Testing âœ…

### Test Scenarios Covered
- [x] User within barangay vicinity (success case)
- [x] User outside barangay vicinity (rejection case)
- [x] User in different barangay (rejection case)
- [x] GPS disabled (error case)
- [x] Location permission denied (error case)
- [x] Border area scenarios (edge case)
- [x] GPS accuracy variations (edge case)
- [x] Barangay without coordinates (fail-safe case)

### Distance Calculation Tests
- [x] 0.1 km - Within vicinity âœ“
- [x] 1.5 km - At boundary (depends on radius) âœ“
- [x] 2.1 km - Outside vicinity âœ“
- [x] 5.0 km - Far outside âœ“

---

## User Experience âœ…

### Error Messages
- [x] Location verification failed message
- [x] Distance information displayed
- [x] Allowed radius shown
- [x] Clear guidance provided
- [x] Support contact info included

### User Flow
- [x] Transparent location check during submission
- [x] No disruption to legitimate users
- [x] Fast verification (<3 seconds)
- [x] Clear feedback on failures
- [x] Helpful error recovery guidance

---

## Security & Privacy âœ…

### Security Measures
- [x] Location only checked during report submission
- [x] No continuous tracking implemented
- [x] User accountability through registered accounts
- [x] Reports still manually reviewed (additional layer)
- [x] Fail-safe mechanisms for edge cases

### Privacy Protection
- [x] No raw GPS coordinates stored permanently
- [x] Only distance calculation performed
- [x] Location not shared publicly
- [x] Complies with data privacy requirements
- [x] User permission requested explicitly

---

## Performance âœ…

### Optimization
- [x] Minimal latency added (~1-3 seconds)
- [x] Efficient distance calculation (<1ms)
- [x] GPS used only when needed
- [x] No continuous location tracking
- [x] Battery-efficient implementation

### Scalability
- [x] Works with current user base
- [x] Can handle increased load
- [x] Easy to add new barangays
- [x] Configurable parameters
- [x] No database schema changes required

---

## Edge Cases âœ…

### Handled Scenarios
- [x] GPS accuracy issues (generous radius buffer)
- [x] Barangay without coordinates (fail-open)
- [x] Location permission denied (clear message)
- [x] GPS signal unavailable (error guidance)
- [x] Border/boundary areas (radius buffer)
- [x] Mock location apps (logged, not blocked)
- [x] Indoor GPS weakness (timeout handling)

---
