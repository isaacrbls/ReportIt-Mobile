# Report Filtering & Form Improvements

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Report Filtering - Show Only Verified & Non-Sensitive Reports**

#### Real-Time Listener Update
**File:** `screens/MapScreen.tsx`

Updated the real-time Firestore listener to filter reports with two conditions:
```typescript
const verifiedReports = allReports.filter(report => 
  report.status === 'Verified' && !report.isSensitive
);
```

#### Manual Fetch Update
Also updated the manual `fetchReports()` function with the same filter:
```typescript
const verifiedReports = result.data.filter(report => 
  report.status === 'Verified' && !report.isSensitive
);
```

#### Behavior
- ‚úÖ **Only Verified Reports:** Reports must have `status === 'Verified'`
- ‚úÖ **Only Non-Sensitive Reports:** Reports must have `isSensitive === false`
- ‚úÖ **Sensitive Reports Hidden:** Reports marked as sensitive will NOT appear on the map
- ‚úÖ **Works Everywhere:** Applies to both initial load and real-time updates

**Why This Matters:**
- Protects privacy of sensitive incidents
- Maintains professional incident reporting standards
- Prevents display of unverified/false reports
- Ensures map only shows publicly appropriate information

### 2. **Report Form Restructure**

#### New Field Order
**File:** `screens/MapScreen.tsx`

The report form has been reorganized to follow a more logical flow:

**Before:**
1. Category
2. Type of incident (text input)
3. Description
4. Mark as sensitive
5. Add media

**After:**
1. **Title of incident** (NEW!)
2. **Type of incident** (dropdown categories)
3. **Description**
4. **Mark as sensitive**
5. **Add media**

---

### 3. **New Title Field**

#### State Management
Added new state variable:
```typescript
const [reportTitle, setReportTitle] = useState('');
```

#### UI Implementation
```tsx
<Text style={styles.reportLabel}>Title of incident</Text>
<TextInput
  style={styles.reportInput}
  value={reportTitle}
  onChangeText={setReportTitle}
  placeholder="Enter incident title (e.g., 'Motorcycle Theft on Main St.')"
  placeholderTextColor="#9CA3AF"
  maxLength={100}
/>
```

#### Features
- ‚úÖ **Required Field:** Validates that title is not empty
- ‚úÖ **Character Limit:** Maximum 100 characters
- ‚úÖ **Helpful Placeholder:** Shows example to guide users
- ‚úÖ **Persisted to Firestore:** Saved as `Title` field

---

### 4. **Improved Category Selection**

#### Changes
- **Label Changed:** "Category" ‚Üí "Type of incident"
- **Remains Dropdown:** Still uses dropdown menu (not text input)
- **Same Categories:** All 15 categories preserved
- **Better Position:** Now appears after title (more logical flow)

#### Categories Available
1. Theft
2. Reports/Agreement
3. Accident
4. Debt / Unpaid Wages Report
5. Defamation Complaint
6. Assault/Harassment
7. Property Damage/Incident
8. Animal Incident
9. Verbal Abuse and Threats
10. Alarm and Scandal
11. Lost Items
12. Scam/Fraud
13. Drugs Addiction
14. Missing Person
15. Others

---

### 5. **Data Model Updates**

#### CreateReportData Interface
**File:** `services/ReportsService.ts`

Added `title` field:
```typescript
export interface CreateReportData {
  barangay: string;
  title: string;        // NEW!
  description: string;
  incidentType: string;
  category?: string;
  isSensitive?: boolean;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  submittedByEmail: string;
  mediaType?: string;
  mediaURL?: string;
}
```

#### Firestore Document Structure
Reports are now saved with:
```typescript
{
  Barangay: string,
  Title: string,              // NEW!
  Description: string,
  IncidentType: string,       // Set from category dropdown
  Category: string,           // Same as IncidentType
  IsSensitive: boolean,
  GeoLocation: GeoPoint,
  Latitude: number,
  Longitude: number,
  SubmittedByEmail: string,
  Status: 'Pending',
  DateTime: ISO timestamp,
  MediaType: string | null,
  MediaURL: string | null,
  hasMedia: boolean,
  createdAt: Timestamp
}
```

---

### 6. **Form Validation**

#### Updated Validation Flow
```typescript
1. Check if title is provided ‚úÖ NEW!
2. Check if category is selected ‚úÖ
3. Check if description is provided ‚úÖ
4. Proceed with submission
```

#### Removed Validations
- ‚ùå "Type of incident" text input (no longer exists)

#### Validation Messages
- **Missing Title:** "Please enter a title for the incident"
- **Missing Category:** "Please select a category for the incident"
- **Missing Description:** "Please provide a description of the incident"

---

### 7. **Form Cleanup**

#### When Form Closes
All fields are now reset:
```typescript
setReportTitle('');          // NEW!
setReportType('');           
setReportDescription('');
setReportCategory('Select type of incident');
setIsSensitive(false);
setSelectedMedia([]);
```

#### Cleanup Triggers
- ‚úÖ After successful submission
- ‚úÖ When user taps "Back" button
- ‚úÖ When modal is closed
