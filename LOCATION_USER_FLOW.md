## 📋 Feature Locations Using This

All these features now have improved location handling:

1. **Initial Map Load**
   - Shows user's current location
   - Centers map on user

2. **Location Button (Crosshair)**
   - Re-centers map on user's location
   - Updates user's current position

3. **Report Submission**
   - Verifies user is in their barangay
   - Captures exact location of incident
   - Two location checks with proper error handling

4. **Permission Request Modal**
   - Asks for permission when needed

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Alert Types

**Native React Native Alerts**
- Uses `Alert.alert()` for all prompts
- Platform-appropriate styling (iOS vs Android)
- Non-blocking UI
- Standard, familiar patterns

**Deep Linking**
- Uses `Linking.openSettings()` from React Native
- Opens app-specific settings page
- Works on both iOS and Android
- Returns user to app when done

### Return Value Handling

```typescript
// LocationService method signature
async getCurrentLocation(): Promise<LocationCoords | null>

// Returns null when:
// 1. Location services are disabled
// 2. Permission is denied
// 3. Unexpected error occurs

// Returns LocationCoords when:
// ✅ Everything works properly
```

### MapScreen Integration

```typescript
// All location calls now handle null gracefully
const location = await locationService.getCurrentLocation();

if (location) {
  // ✅ Use the location
  setUserLocation(location);
} else {
  // ℹ️ Alert already shown by LocationService
  // Just stop the current operation
  return;
}
```
